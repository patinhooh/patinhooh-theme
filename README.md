## Inspirations

The creation of my theme drew significant inspiration from the following:

- **[Monokai](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/extensions/theme-monokai)**: This theme served as the starting point for the palette. It was my go-to theme before I decided to craft my own.
- **[Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme/)**: Provided valuable examples for syntax highlighting and offered insightful guidance during the early stages of development.
